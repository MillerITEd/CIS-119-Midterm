PART 1:
The formula for the area of a circle is:
pi x (radius squared)

The formula for the circumference of a circle is:
2 x pi x radius

Write an algorithm, in pseudocode, that:
  asks the user for the radius of a circle
  calculates the area of the circle
  calculates the circumference of the circle
  displays the calculated area and circumference to the user

(Use 3.14 for pi)


PART 2:
Write an algorithm, in pseudocode, to:
  prompt the user to enter 3 numbers
  determine which 2 numbers, when added together, result in the largest sum
  tell the user which 2 numbers those are and what their sum is


PART 3:
Write an algorithm, in pseudocode, to:
  prompt the user to enter a starting number and an ending number
  beginning with the starting number, display every other number up to
  the ending number
  
  (In other words, count by 2's from the starting
  number to the ending number. The ending number itself may or 
  may not display, but the final number displayed should not be 
  greater than the ending number.)
  
  BONUS POINT: What condition is necessary for both the
  starting and ending number to display?
